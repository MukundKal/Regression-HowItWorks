# Regression-HowItWorks
Digging into the regression algorithm, undertstanding and coding it from scratch.

The _Best-Fit Line_ to a particular set of data is the linear line that fits it the most.
But is it an accurate/good-fit to that data?

The _Good-Fit Line_ is the line that is the most accurate to that data.
The **R<sup>2</sup>** or the _coefficent of determination_ indicates the extent of how well the line has fit the data and this s done using **Sqaured Error**
